In traditional Islam, meaning is found through worship and rituals.  \n\nAll these perspectives point to the idea that meaning is subjective, derived from personal values, cultural practices, or philosophical inquiry.

It marked the first time that humans landed on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\nApollo 11, the first space mission to put people on the Moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. Almost every major aspect of the flight of Apollo 11 was witnessed via television by hundreds of millions of people in nearly every part of the globe, until splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Apollo 11's crew members were commander Neil Armstrong, lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin, and command module pilot Michael Collins. The lunar module Eagle of the Apollo 11 mission landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon and walk on the lunar surface. (more) Apollo 11, U.S. spaceflight during which commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Edwin (“Buzz”) Aldrin, Jr., on July 20, 1969, became the first people to land on the Moon and walk the lunar surface.\nArmstrong was one of nine men chosen of NASA’s second astronaut group in 1962, and flew to space on the Gemini 8 mission in 1966 before being assigned to the Apollo 11 mission. “Buzz” Aldrin was selected in NASA’s third astronaut class in 1963 and went to space on Gemini XII before becoming the lunar module pilot for Apollo 11. Watch highlights from the Apollo 11 mission including the launch on July 16, 1969, the landing of the lunar module, Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon, splashdown, and more. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, HOUSTON, TEXAS – With a half-Earth in the background, the Lunar Module ascent stage with Moon-walking astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr. approaches for a rendezvous with the Apollo Command Module manned by Michael Collins.\nIt’s a little over eight years since the flights of Gagarin and Shepard, followed quickly by President Kennedy’s challenge to put a man on the moon before the decade is out. Now, on the morning of July 16, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins sit atop another Saturn V at Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The three-stage 363-foot rocket will use its 7.5 million pounds of thrust to propel them into space and into history. With more than half a billion people watching on television, he climbs down the ladder and proclaims: “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Aldrin joins him shortly, and offers a simple but powerful description of the lunar surface: “magnificent desolation.” They explore the surface for two and a half hours, collecting samples and taking photographs. Men from Earth have walked on the moon and returned safely home.\n5 min read ### What’s Up: March 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASA article 3 days ago 2 min read ### Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES)-2025 to be Released Soon. 6 min read ### NASA’s Webb Exposes Complex Atmosphere of Starless Super-Jupiter article 14 hours ago 3 min read ### NASA Uses New Technology to Understand California Wildfires article 3 days ago 2 min read ### Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES)-2025 to be Released Soon. 3 min read ### University High Knows the Answers at NASA JPL Regional Science Bowl article 8 hours ago 2 min read ### Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES)-2025 to be Released Soon.\nQwen Chatbot: During the Apollo 11 moon landing, the following key events occurred:  \n\n1. **Launch**: The Apollo 11 mission was launched on July 16, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center, Houston, Texas.  \n2. **First Steps**: On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon's surface.
