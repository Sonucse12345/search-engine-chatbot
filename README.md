# AI Chatbot using Tavily Search Engine and Qwen Model for Real-Time Responses

## Problem Statement

This project aims to build a comprehensive AI chatbot that uses **Tavily Search Engine** for real-time, accurate web searches and the **Qwen Model** for generating responses based on those searches. The goal is to create an AI assistant that can efficiently search for relevant information and provide detailed, meaningful answers to a wide range of user queries.

## Features

- **Real-time Search**: Uses the **Tavily Search Engine** to perform real-time web searches based on user queries.
- **Contextual Responses**: Integrates the relevant information retrieved from search results to provide contextually accurate and meaningful answers.
- **Qwen Model Integration**: Leverages the **Qwen Model** for generating human-like responses based on the retrieved web context.
- **Conversational Interface**: Provides an interactive conversational interface where users can ask questions and receive detailed responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Tavily Search Engine**: A powerful search tool to retrieve relevant web results for better context in chatbot responses.
- **Qwen Model**: A large-scale AI language model for generating human-like responses based on contextual information.
- **Python**: The main programming language used to implement the chatbot.
- **Requests Library**: Used to make HTTP requests to interact with the **Tavily Search Engine** and other APIs.
- **LLM**: Integration of a **Large Language Model** (Qwen Model) for generating contextual responses.
- **Ngrok**: Exposes the local Streamlit app to the public internet, allowing users to interact with the chatbot remotely.
